# SharedStreets Referencing Sytem

SharedStreets is a framework for creating and exchanging street-linked data. Unlike GIS-based methods for data exchange that depend on geometry or predefined, proprietary identifiers to describe streets, the SharedStreets Referencing system uses topology, and other descriptive properties to define street locations. SharedStreets references allow users to share street-linked data without sharing underlying map data, or require that users agree on a common base map.
